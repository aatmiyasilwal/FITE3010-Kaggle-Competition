# FITE3010 Group Project

## TMDB Box Office Prediction

### Overview
This Jupyter notebook serves as part of the group project for the FITE3010 course, aiming to predict the worldwide box office revenue of movies based on various metadata from The Movie Database (TMDB). The dataset comprises over 7,000 films and includes features such as cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, and more.

### Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the TMDB Box Office Prediction competition on Kaggle. It provides rich metadata that can be used to train predictive models for estimating box office revenue.

### Key Steps in the Notebook
1. **Data Download**: The notebook begins by installing the Kaggle API and downloading the dataset necessary for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial analysis is conducted to understand the structure and contents of the dataset, including shape, data types, and missing values.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Irrelevant and redundant features are dropped to streamline the dataset for modeling.
4. **Descriptive Statistics**: Descriptive statistics are computed for both training and testing datasets to gain insights into the data distributions.
5. **Feature Engineering**: Additional steps may involve transforming or creating new features that can enhance model performance.
